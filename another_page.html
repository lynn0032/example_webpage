	<h1>This is a completely different page</h1>
	<p>It's not the same as the first page. The first page had a picture of Teddy on it. This page does not have a picture of Teddy on it. You are very impressed by the variety of webpages I have created.</p>
	<h1>Hey look, it's another heading</h1>
	<p>I'm so good at making webpages. This one uses an external CSS. Huzzah! Here is a <a href=index.html#BB>Very Impressive Link</a> that you can use to get back to the first page.</p>
